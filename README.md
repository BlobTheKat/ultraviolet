# _Ultraviolet_

Fast lightweight 2D graphics library powered by `webgl2`

Why use ultraviolet?
1. **Custom GLSL shader**
2. **Lightweight (20.5KiB)**
3. **Fast bulk-drawing**
4. **Make use of GPU features such as stencil buffer, texture formats, VAOs, ...**

Features:
- Texture, texture arrays
- Many texture formats including integer textures
- Texture customization (wrap mode, filtering, mipmaps)
- Render to other targets or textures
- Read pixels from a target or canvas
- Canvas2D-like transformations (`.translate()`, `.scale()`, `.rotate()`, ...)
- GLSL Shaders
- Meshes, allowing fast bulk-drawing of thousands or millions of sprites
- Custom-use sprite properties (for use within shaders)
- Mesh export/importing
- Stencil buffer access for clipping
- Customizable blend algorithms
- 8 textures and 6 uniforms per draw operation
